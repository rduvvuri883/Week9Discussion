•	What are the tradeoffs with a serverless architecture?
While we appreciate the advantages Serverless architecture has to offer, below are few key tradeoff’s from my viewpoint:
1)	Manual efforts in configuring on-premise setup to be compatible with the elasticity feature of the cloud.
2)	Code migration from one service provider to another might not be as big of an issue as with assessing the impact on the moving parts such as additional services that needs to be accounted for with the migration. This hinders portability factor to some extent.
3)	A test or development environment for us to replicate an issue and debug is not on-par with on-premise setup.

•	What are the advantages of developing with Cloud9 ?
Flexibility of working from anywhere with internet access in writing, running and debugging a piece of code where we do not need to install programs or software/updates as well as worry about underlying hardware that are needed in running our code in a typical on-premise setup. 
Cloud9 also allows collaborative coding along with the feature to connect with team members on live chats.
